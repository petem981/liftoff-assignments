# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide feedback and direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline, or if you have to change some things later.

## Assignment Description
[Project Outline Assignment](https://education.launchcode.org/liftoff/assignments/project-outline/)

## Submission Instructions

1.  Overview: Website that allows equine owners to create a record/history of their horse(s). (e.g., maintenance schedule for vaccinations, farrier/blacksmith services, teeth floating, acute veterinary needs & follow up, training schedules, nutrition/supplement tracking). Will also utilize APIs to pull in local emergency vet services that are available (Google maps).
2.  Features:
                User login
                Email confirmation
                Form submission for user profile: name, email, address & phone number.
                Form submission for horse profile: name,
            Navigation bar options:
                [Demographics]: breed(including registered assoc. number, if applicable), age, coloration.
                [Health & Wellness]: vaccination schedule, farrier/blacksmith services, teeth floating, acute veterinary needs & follow up, lameness management/maintenance.
                [Training/Discipline]: training-to-date, discipline, awards/points.
                [Emergency Services]: DVM name, address, phone & a ‘find emergency services’ option based on location input.
                [Barn]: where the horse(s) regularly stay, barn owner/manager information, link to website(if available).
3.  Technologies:
                Python
                Flask
                MySQL

                JavaScript
                JQuery
                Java
4.  What I’ll have to learn: This will be a hard core reality check on how much I have learned from everything in LC101. I will have to learn how/whether I can integrate my existing code from previous assignments. I will have to learn how to use data from several APIs (with any luck), in order to integrate a useful user experience. I also plan on using this project as a way to learn to use more Front End languages like JavaScript. (Would also like to learn how to make this web app into an optional mobile/tablet application in the future.)
